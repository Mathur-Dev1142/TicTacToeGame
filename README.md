# TicTacToeGame

Hey guys I made this exciting project called TicTacToe game. It is the same game we all are familiar with except I made the same using react.
I used vite build tool and sass styling to implement certain components that I deemed necessary for the project.
I hope you all like this.

I added a Board component which contains all the board layout of the game and another sqaure component which contains all the information regarding sqaures.
All other necessary components are in the master branch of my git file. You can check it out.
